Introduction and Overview
**********************************************************************

This page offers a quick introduction to the theory and practice of
:mod:`meep_adjoint`, beginning with a basic backgrounder on adjoint
methods in general, then considering some representative design-optimization
problems and outlining typical workflows for tackling
in :mod:`meep_adjoint`.
Adjoint experts will probably want to skim much of this before
moving on to the detailed step-by-step :doc:`tutorial <../Tutorial/index>`,
but are first encouraged at least to glance at our conventions for
what constitute the
:doc:`essential defining ingredients of optimization problems <OptProbIngredients_>`_.


======================================================================
Background: Automated design optimization and the adjoint method
======================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Electromagnetic design optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common task in electromagnetic engineering is to custom-tune the design
of some component of a system---a waveguide taper, a power splitter,
an input coupler, an antenna, etc.---to optimize the performance of the system
as defined by some problem-specific metric. For our purposes,
the performance metric will always be a physical quantity computed
from frequency-domain electromagnetic fields---a `power flux <GetFluxes_>`_,
an `energy density <DFTEnergy_>`_,
an `eigenmode expansion coefficient <EigenCoefficients_>`_,
or perhaps some mathematical function of one or more such
quantities---which we will denote
:math:`f^\text{obj}` or simply :math:`f` and refer to
as the *objective function*.

Meanwhile, the "design" entity that will be at our disposal
to tweak and adjust in the service of optimizing :math:`f^\text{obj}`
will be just the spatially-varying scalar dielectric function
:math:`\epsilon^\text{des}(\mathbf x)` throughout some
fixed subregion of the geometry (the *design region*
:math:`\mathcal{V}^\text{des}`).
Of course, we will want to restrict consideration to designs that can actually be fabricated in the real world;
at a minimum this means that the permittivity
at each spatial point must satisfy the conditions imposed on
physical materials by causality (which, for the
simplest case of nondispersive dielectrics, are just that
:math:`\epsilon` be everywhere real-valued and :math:`\ge 1`),
but in some cases we might want to impose additional
constraints---such as minimum linewidths---to reflect
the limitations of practical fabrication techniques.

Thus, the problems we consider will be of the
general schematic form

.. math::

    \text{ for } \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{V}^\text{des},
    \text{ find }\epsilon^\text{des}(\mathbf{x})
    \text{ to optimize } f^\text{obj}
    \tag{1}

subject to the constraints that
:math:`\epsilon^\text{des}` be physical
and (optionally) fabricatable.

--------------------------------------------------
First Examples: Holey waveguide and optical router
--------------------------------------------------
Here are two representative examples that we will use
for illustrative purposes throughout this documentation
(and for diagnostic purposes in the `test suite <../TestSuite/index>`_).

First, the **Holey Waveguide** is a *toy* problem that fits the form
of :eq:`formulation`: a simple section of waveguide, nearly pristine,
but containing one region from which the dielectric material has been
scooped out, leaving a hole:

.. image:: HoleyWaveguideGeometry.png


In the presence of the hole, a wave entering the waveguide section
from the left will be partially reflected, so that not all of the
power it carries it will exit from the right. The design-optimization
problem is to optimize the permittivity distribution in the hole region
to maximize output power (for fixed input power). Obviously the correct
answer is just to fill in the hole uniformly with the waveguide
material, and the ability to figure this out is a simple,
easy-to-debug test of the efficacy any optimization paradigm.


A less trivial example is the **Cross Router,** in which we
envision 4 waveguides conjoined by a central hub region,
whose design we will adjust to route signals from one port
to another:

--------------------------------------------------
Examples
--------------------------------------------------


.. math::

    \epsilon^\text{design}(\mathbf x)\approx
    \sum_{d=1}^D \beta_d b_d(\mathbf x)


naively, this would give us uncountably many degrees of
freedom and allow permittivity functions of
arbitrarily rapid spatial variation, but such a design
space would be both mathematically unwieldy and technologically
unrealistic (in view of the finite lithographic linewidths
and other constraints posed by real-world fabrication methods),
whereupon in general we will approximate the design function
as a finite expansion of the form


.. math::

    \epsilon^\text{design}(\mathbf x)\approx
    \sum_{d=1}^D \beta_d b_d(\mathbf x)

where :math:`\{b_d(\mathbf{x})\}, d=1,\cdots,D` is some conveniently-chosen
set of :math:`D`ple, in the :doc:`cross router <Examples/cross_router>`
        example in the :mod:`meep_adjoint` :doc:`example gallery <Examples/index>`,
        the task is to design the central hub region to steer
        incoming power arriving via the **West** input waveguide port
        entirely to the **North** output waveguide port, ideally with zero
        leakage power emitted from the **South** and **East**

        To formulate this problem mathematically, suppose we
        represent the unknown design function as an expansion in some
        convenient finite set of basis functions:

This restricts the space of possible design functions to the span
of the :math:`\{b_d\}` and reduces our mathematical problem to
finding values for the :math:`\{\beta_d\}` coefficients
that optimize the objective function---subject, of course, to
appropriate physicality constraints on $\epsilon$.
If we restrict consideration to nondispersive media, the
conditions for a physical permittivity are simply
:math:`\text{Re }\epsilon\ge 1, \text{Im }\epsilon = 0`,
and the mathematical formulation of our design challenge
takes the form


.. math::
   :label: opt_prob

    \text{find } \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^D
    \text{ such that }
    f^\text{obj}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \text{optimum},

    \text{subject to}
    \sum_{d=1}^D \beta_d b_d(\mathbf x) \ge 1,
     \,\,\,\, \forall \,\,\,\, \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{V}^\text{design}

This is a $D$-dimensional optimization problem subject to linear
inequality constraints.[#]_


We will shortly present a smorgasbord of examples; for now,
perhaps a good one to have in mind is the
[hole cloak ](#HoleCloak) discussed below, in which a
chunk of material has been removed from an otherwise perfect waveguide
section, ruining the otherwise perfectly unidirectional (no scattering or reflection)
flow of power from a source at one end of the guide to a sink at the other;
our task is to tweak the permittivity in an annular region
surrounding the defect (the *cloak*) so as to restore
as much as possible the reflectionless transfer of power
across the waveguide---thus hiding or "cloaking"
the presence of defect from external detection.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:codename:`meep` is a tool for computing objective-function values...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, for a given a candidate design :math:`\epsilon^{\text{trial}}(\mathbf{x})`,
it's clear that we can use :mod:`meep`---*core*:py:mod:`meep`,
that is, no fancy new packages required---to evaluate
the objective function and assess the candidate's performance: we simply
**(1)** create a :mod:`meep` geometry with `GeometricObjects` for
the waveguides and a `Block` with :math:`\epsilon\sup{trial}` as a
`spatially-varying permittivity function <EpsFunc_>`_ in the design region,
**(2)** add `DFT cells <FluxSpectra_>`_ to tabulate the frequency-domain
Poynting flux entering and departing the cloak region,
**(3)** `timestep <RunStepFunctions_>`_ until the frequency-domain
fields converge, then **(4)** use post-processing routines like
` ``get_fluxes()`` <GetFluxes_>`_
or
` ``get_eigenmode_coefficients`` <EigenCoefficients_>`_
to get the quantities needed to evaluate the objective function.
This is a totally standard application of canonical :mod:`meep`
functionality, and it has the effect of converting our engineering
design problem into a pure numerical optimization problem: given
a

Thus, for the cost of one full :mod:`meep` timestepping
run we obtain the value of our objective function at one point
in the parameter space of possible inputs.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...but function *values* alone aren't enough for efficient optimization.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But *now* what do we do?! The difficulty is that the computation
izinust described furnishes only the *value* of the objective function
for a given input, not its *derivatives* with respect to the
design variables---and thus yields zero insight into how we should
tweak the design to improve performance.
In simple cases we might hope to proceed on the basis of physical
intuition, while
for small problems with just a few parameters we might try our luck with a
`derivative-free optimization algorithm`_;
however, both of these approaches will run out of steam long before
we scale up to
the full complexity of a practical problem with thousands
of degrees of freedom.
Alternatively, we could get approximate derivative information by brute-force
finite-differencing---slightly tweaking one design variable, repeating
the full timestepping run, and asking how the results changed---but
proceeding this way to compute derivatives with respect to all :math:`D`
design variables would require fully :math:`D` separate timestepping runs;
for the problem sizes we have in mind, this would make calculating the
objective-function gradient
*several thousand times* more costly than calculating its value.
So we face a dilemma: How can we obtain the derivative information
necessary for effective optimization in a reasonable amount of time?
This is where adjoints come to the rescue.


.. _derivative-free optimization algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:mod:`meep_adjoint` is a tool for computing objective-function *gradients*.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *adjoint method* of sensitivity analysis is a technique in which
we exploit certain facts about the physics of a problem and the
consequent mathematical structure---specifically, in this case, the
linearity and reciprocity of Maxwell's equations---to rearrange the
calculation of derivatives in a way that yields an *enormous* speedup
over the brute-force finite-difference approach. More specifically,
after we have computed the objective-function value by doing
the full :mod:`meep` timestepping run mentioned
above---the "forward" run in adjoint-method parlance---we can magically
compute its derivatives with respect to *all* design variables by doing
just *one* additional timestepping run with a funny-looking choice
of sources and outputs (the "adjoint" run).
Thus, whereas gradient computation via finite-differencing is at least :math:`D`
times more expensive than computing the objective function value,
with adjoints we get both value and gradient for roughly just *twice* the
cost of the value alone. Such a bargain! At this modest cost, derivative-based
optimization becomes entirely feasible.

Examples of optimization problems
======================================================================

Throughout the `meep_adjoint` documentation we will refer to a running collection of
simple optimization problems to illustrate the mechanics of optimization,
among which are the following; click the geometry images to view
in higher resolution.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Holey Waveguide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By way of warm-up, a useful toy version of an optimization problem
is an otherwise pristine length of dielectric slab waveguide in
which a careless technician has torn a circular `hole` of variable
permittivity :math:`\epsilon\sup{hole}`.

Incident power from an
`eigenmode source <EigenModeSource_>`_ (cyan line in figure)
travels leftward through the waveguide, but is partially
reflected by the hole, resulting in less than 100% power
the waveguide output (as may be
characterized in :mod:`meep`
by observing power flux and/or
eigenmode expansion coefficients at the two
flux monitors, labeled `east` and `west`).
Our objective is to tweak the value of
:math:`\epsilon\sup{hole}` to maximize transmission
as assessed by one of these metrics.
The simplicity of this model makes it a useful
initial warm-up and sanity check for making sure we know
what we are doing in design optimization; for example,
`in this worked example <AdjointVsFDTest_>`_
we use it to confirm the numerical accuracy of
adjoint-based gradients computed by `mp.adjoint`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Hole Cloak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We obtain a more challenging variant of the holey-waveguide problem
be supposing that the material in the hole region is *not* a
tunable design parameter---it is fixed at vacuum, say, or
perfect metal---but that we *are* allowed to vary the permittivity
in an annular region surrounding the hole in such a way
as to mimic the effect of filling in the hole, i.e. of hiding
or "cloaking" the hole  as much as  possible from external
 detection.

> :bookmark:{.center}
>
> ![zoomify](images/HoleCloakBGeometry.png)

For the hole-cloak optimization, the objective function
will most likely the same as that considered above---namely,
to maximize the Poynting flux through the flux monitor
labeled `east` (a quantity we label :math:`S\subs{east}`)
 or perhaps to maximize the overlap coefficient
between the actual fields passing through monitor
``east`` and the fields of (say)
the :math:`n`th forward- or backward-traveling eigenmode
of the waveguide (which we label :math:`\{P,M\}_{n,\text{east}}`
with :math:`P,M` standing for "plus and minus.")
On the other hand, the design space here is more
complicated than for the simple hole, consisting
of all possible scalar functions :math:`\epsilon(r,\theta)`
defined on the annular cloak region.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cross-router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A different flavor of waveguide-optimization problem arises when we
consider the *routing* of signals from given inputs to
given destinations. One example is the *cross-router*, involving
an intersection between :math:`x-`directed and :math:`y-`directed waveguides,
with center region of variable permittivity that we may
tweak to control the routing of power through it.

> :bookmark:{.center}
>
> ![zoomify](images/RouterGeometry_Iter0.png)

Whereas in the previous examples there was more or less
only one reasonable design objective one might realistically
want to optimize,
for a problem like this there are many possibilities.
For example, given fixed input power supplied by an eigenmode
source on the "western" branch (cyan line),
we might be less interested in the absolute output
power at any port and more concerned with
achieving maximal *equality* of output
power among the north, south, and east outputs,
whereupon we might minimize an objective function of
the form
:math:``f\sub{obj}  =
   \Big( S\sub{north} - S\sub{south}\Big)^2
  +\Big( S\sub{north} - S\sub{east}\Big)^2
 + \Big( S\sub{east} - S\sub{south}\Big)^2
:math:``
(or a similar functional form involving eigenmode
coefficients).
Alternatively, perhaps we don't care what happens in
the southern branch, but we really want the fields
traveling past the `north` monitor
to have twice as much
overlap with the forward-traveling 3rd eigenmode of that
waveguide
as the `east` fields have with their backward-traveling
2nd eigenmode:

:math:`` f\sub{obj} \equiv \Big( P\sub{3,north} - 2M\sub{2,east}\Big)^2:math:``

The point is that the definition of an optimization problem
involves not only a set of physical quantities  (power fluxes, eigenmode coefficients,
etc.) that we compute from :mod:`meep` calculations,
but also a rule (the objective function :math:`f`) for crunching those
numbers in some specific way to define a single scalar figure of merit.

In  `mp.adjoint` we use the collective term *objective quantities*
for the power fluxes, eigenmode coefficients, and other physical quantities
needed to compute the objective function.
Similarly, the special geometric subregions of
:mod:`meep` geometries with
which objective quantities are associated---the
cross-sectional flux planes of `DFTFlux` cells or
field-energy boxes of `DFTField` cells----are known as *objective regions.*

The `Example Gallery <ExampleGallery.md_>`_ includes a worked example
of a full successful iterative optimization in which
`mp.adjoint` begins with the design shown above and thoroughly rejiggers
it over the course of 50 iterations to yield a device
that efficiently routs power around a 90&degree; bend
from the eigenmode source (cyan line above)
to the 'north' output port.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The asymmetric splitter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `splitter` seeks to divide incoming power from one source
in some specific way among two or more destinations.,
We will consider an asymmetric splitter in which power
arriving from a single incoming waveguide is to be routed
into two outgoing waveguides by varying the design of the
central coupler region:

In brief,

.. glossary::

    Objective function, objective quantities, objective regions
        The *objective function* is the real-valued scalar quantity
        that :mod:`meep_adjoint` tries to maximize [#f1]_.




    regions:** One or more `regions over which to tabulate frequency-domain fields (DFT cells) <DFTObj_>`_
  for use in computing power fluxes, mode-expansion coefficients, and other frequency-domain
  quantities used in characterizing device performance.  Because these regions are used to evaluate
  objective functions, we refer to them as *objective regions.*

+ **Design region:** A specification of the region over which the material design is to be
    optimized, i.e. the region in which the permittivity is given by the
    design quantity :math:`\epsilon\sup{des}(\mathbf x)`.
    We refer to this as the *design region* :math:`\mathcal{V}\sup{des}`.

+ **Basis:** Because the design variable :math:`\epsilon\sup{des}(\mathbf x)`
    is a continuous function defined throughout a finite volume of space,
    technically it involves infinitely many degrees of freedom.
    To yield a finite-dimensional optimization problem, it is convenient
    to approximate :math:`\epsilon\sup{des}` as a finite expansion in some
    convenient set of basis functions, i.e.
    :math:`` \epsilon(\mathbf x) \equiv \sum_{d=1}^N \beta_d \mathcal{b}_d(\mathbf x),
       \qquad \mathbf x\in \mathcal{V}\sup{des},
    :math:``
    where :math:`\{\mathcal{b}_n(\mathbf x)\}` is a set of :math:`D` scalar-valued
    basis functions defined for :math:`\mathbf x\in\mathcal{V}\sup{des}`.
    The task of the optimizer then becomes to determine
    numerical values for the :math:`N`-vector of coefficients
    :math:`\boldsymbol{\beta}=\{\beta_n\},n=1,\cdots,N.`

    For adjoint optimization in :mod:`meep`, the
    basis set is chosen by the user, either from among a predefined collection of
    common basis sets, or as an arbitrary user-defined basis set specified by
    subclassing an abstract base class in `mp.adjoint.`


.. [#] Technically, equation (1) appears to be imposing uncountably many
       constraints (one for each point :math:`\mathbf{x}` in the design region)
       on our finite set of design variables; we will describe later how
       to extract a finite number of constraints for numerical optimization.
